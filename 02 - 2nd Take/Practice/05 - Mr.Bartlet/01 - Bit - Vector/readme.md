# Variation 1 - Bitmask (char holding int value)

This is the most common and space-efficient way to implement a bit vector set. An unsigned `char` (or `int`) is used, and elements are added by setting the corresponding bit using the bitwise OR operator.

### Explanation

1. **`initialize()`**: Resets the entire bit vector (in this case, a `char`) to `0`.
2. **`insert()`**: Adds an element to the set by setting its corresponding bit to `1`. It uses bitwise OR to set the bit.
3. **`delete()`**: Removes an element from the set by setting its corresponding bit to `0`. It inverts the bitmask before applying a bitwise AND.
4. **`find()`**: Checks if an element is present in the set by checking the corresponding bit.
5. **`union()`**: Returns the union of two sets (combined set of elements) using the Bitwise OR operator.
6. **`intersection()`**: Returns the intersection of two sets (common elements) using the Bitwise AND operator.
7. **`difference()`**: Returns the difference between two sets (elements in A but not in B) using A AND (NOT B).
8. **`display()`**: Iterates through all possible elements and displays the ones that are set.

### Notes

- The elements are represented as positions in the bitmask, where each element corresponds to a bit in the byte/integer.
- This method of implementation is compact and efficient, utilizing bitwise operations for set operations.

# Variation 2 - Bit fields

Bit fields allow the compiler to pack structure members into a small number of bits. The struct itself holds the bit set.

Example:
```c
typedef struct {
    // 'field: 8' defines 'field' to be exactly 8 bits wide.
    unsigned int field : 8;
} Set;
```

### Explanation

1. **`initialize()`**: Resets the bit field (`field`) to `0`.
2. **`insert()`**: Adds an element to the set by setting its corresponding bit to `1`. It uses Bitwise OR to set the bit.
3. **`delete()`**: Removes an element from the set by clearing its corresponding bit (setting it to `0`). It uses Bitwise AND NOT after inverting the bitmask.
4. **`find()`**: Checks if an element is present in the set by checking its corresponding bit using Bitwise AND.
5. **`union()`**: Combines two sets using Bitwise OR to include all elements from both sets.
6. **`intersection()`**: Finds common elements between two sets using Bitwise AND.
7. **`difference()`**: Returns the difference between two sets (elements in A but not in B) using A AND (NOT B).
8. **`display()`**: Iterates through all possible elements (0 to 7) and displays those that are set (i.e., their corresponding bit is `1`).

### Notes

- Bit fields are packed into the structure with a specified width (in this case, 8 bits), and operations on them are performed using bitwise operators.
- The use of bit fields ensures that memory usage is minimized when only a small number of bits are required for storage.

# Variation 3 - Boolean/Enum Array

This implementation uses an array where the index represents the element and the value (`true/false`) represents membership.

Example:
```c
#define ARRAY_SIZE 8

// The set itself is just an array of booleans/integers.
typedef bool Set[ARRAY_SIZE];
```

### Explanation

1. **`initialize()`**: Resets all elements in the array to `false`.
2. **`insert()`**: Adds an element to the set by setting the array index corresponding to the element to `true`.
3. **`delete()`**: Removes an element from the set by setting its array index to `false`.
4. **`find()`**: Checks if an element is present in the set by returning the boolean value stored at its array index.
5. **`union()`**: Combines two sets by setting each index in the result to `true` if it is `true` in either set.
6. **`intersection()`**: Finds common elements between two sets by setting each index in the result to `true` only if it is `true` in both sets.
7. **`difference()`**: Returns the elements in A but not in B by setting each index in the result to `true` only if it is `true` in A and `false` in B.
8. **`display()`**: Iterates through all possible indices and prints those that are `true`.

### Notes

- Each element of the set is represented by a **boolean array index**.
- Membership is indicated directly by the value at each index (`true` = present, `false` = absent).
- This approach is simple and easy to understand, but it uses more memory compared to bitmask or bit field implementations.
- Operations run in **O(n)** time since all possible indices may need to be checked.
