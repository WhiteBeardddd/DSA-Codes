# Stack your AESPA songs

> “This is my drama” — and you’re coding the plot.

You are tasked to simulate a music album system using a **stack (LIFO)** data structure implemented as a linked list. The album contains songs pushed in reverse chronological order (latest songs on top), and you must support standard stack operations: **push, pop, peek, and isEmpty**.

Each album also holds metadata about the artist (a K-pop group named **Aespa**), including their name, agency, debut year, and the names of the members.

---

## Your task
You must complete several functions to support this system.

There is no direct input from the user. You must:

- Initialize the album with default values
- Populate it with song data (from a given library)
- Implement stack operations on songs

---

## Program output
Your program should produce outputs based on specific function calls:

- Display album metadata and tracklist
- Print messages when popping songs
- Print the top song via `peekSong`

✨ **Good luck, and stan aespa!**
