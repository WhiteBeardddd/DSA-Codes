# Ciscode Practice Activities

This folder contains my **Ciscode practice activities**.  

**Ciscode** is a web-based coding platform launched by the **Department of Computer, Information Sciences, and Mathematics (DCISM)** at the **University of San Carlos (USC)**.  
It serves as a practice and assessment environment for programming, data structures, and algorithm-related problems, similar to other online judges.

## Contents
- Solutions to practice problems from Ciscode  
- Exercises on data structures, algorithms, and other programming topics  
- Notes and references for future review

## Purpose
The goal of this folder is to:
- Document my progress in solving **Ciscode problems**  
- Serve as a personal reference for studying **DSA and programming concepts**  
- Keep track of my **coursework and practice** within the USC DCISM ecosystem
