# üîç [E2] Google Search Cache  
**by Edwin Bartlett**

---

## üí° Overview

OMG. Google is secretly low on budget!  
That's why they decided to replace their **expensive caching system** with a cheap alternative ‚Äî and they‚Äôre turning to **students like you** to create their new caching system.  

Can you do it?  
Of course you can, thanks to the incredible things you‚Äôve learned in school!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Description

Use an **Open Hashing Dictionary** to store **search query strings**.  
Each search query string is associated with an **array of search results**.  

Using this caching system, search results will now be served **much faster** to users ‚Äî rather than querying the database every single time!

---

## üß© Core Operations

- **Lookup** ‚Üí ‚ÄúCheck if this key exists‚Äù  
- **Insertion** ‚Üí ‚ÄúStore this new key/value‚Äù

---

## üß† Function Specifications

### `void init_cache(HashTable *table)`
Initializes the hash table, setting all buckets to `NULL`.

---

### `char **lookup_cache(HashTable *table, const char *key)`
- Looks up a key in the cache.  
- Returns a pointer to the internal result array (**size 3**) if found (**CACHE HIT**), otherwise returns `NULL`.

---

### `bool insert_cache(HashTable *table, const char *key)`
- Attempts to insert a new key/value pair into the cache.  
- If the key already exists ‚Üí insertion is **skipped**.  
- If the key is new ‚Üí it calls `simulate_database_fetch()` to get the results.  
- Returns:
  - `true` ‚Üí on successful insertion or skipped (existing key)
  - `false` ‚Üí on failure

---

### `char **simulate_database_fetch(const char *key)`
- Simulates an **expensive database query** to get results.  
- Returns a dynamically allocated array of result strings, or `NULL`.  
- This function is **GIVEN** ‚Äî all you need to do is **CALL** it.
