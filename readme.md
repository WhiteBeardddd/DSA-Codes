# Data Structures and Algorithms in C Programming
---
## This repository is for my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class in the 1st Semester of 2025.

It will contain my codes written in C, covering different data structures and algorithm implementations, such as:

ðŸ“‚ Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees

ðŸ”— Graphs and their traversals

âš¡ Sorting and Searching algorithms

ðŸ§© Problem-solving using C programming concepts

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of DSA through actual implementations, while serving as a record of my coding journey during 2025.
